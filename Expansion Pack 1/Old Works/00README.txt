Hey there!
These are some random resources I've been using to make fan cards for the 7th continent. It's just a folder with all the files I've been using, so it's extremely messy.
I still hope it will be useful to you. :)
I use Inkscape for all graphical work, and GIMP to edit bitmaps - I highly recommend both. They are free and open-source.

There is a blank idea card - blank.png, and a blank character card.
There are some graphics, most notably a badly erased banner.
There is a big slow xcf file I pulled from the rulebook, it's called drawing.xcf. It has vector graphics of most icons. I suggest using raster versons of anything containing gradients (most notably stars and numboxes), though, because those graphics are extremesly slow on Inkscape.
Then there are a the project files for my own cards. I suggest using those as starting points.
Then, you can pull any missing graphics from the rulebook, or from drawing.xcf.

I received permission from Serious Poulp to post these files. Obviously they are in no way official, but you and I are free to use them as long as we don't make any money out of this.

Make some great cards!
